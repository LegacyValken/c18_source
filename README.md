> (Alias V2a) (20x?) Alto provided a partial VMF to the community when he burned out
> (Alias V2b) (2016) Starship Trooper created a cursed development path useing a decompile of V2 merged with V2a to create a deeply unpopular opioniated design patway. 11 versions of this false path were developed before being scraped.

> (2017 - 2018) With the failure of V2b Starship Trooper returned with the goal of cleaning up the overall map health while preserving design changes to others and the community. The base of the code was from V1a with imports from a decompiled V2. 21 versions of this path were developed. 
> V3 Hotfix the train station window texture in plaza spawns lights unless removed from lights.rad. (Video of the issue: https://youtu.be/4aE6apvFjuA) Deleteing Building_Trainstation_window002d from lights.rad will let the developer compile the map with out the extra lights spawned in. The lights are very dim but are still used to calculate reflections of player spawned items in plaza tanking performance. 
> V3A was the handoff between Starship Trooper & Grandad, The hand off was tricky as we needed to line up our compile processes workflows and map file name had been a consistent issue.
